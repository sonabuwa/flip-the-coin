### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create interactive user experiences. I improved my understanding of event listeners and how to handle user interactions dynamically. Additionally, I gained experience in debugging and optimizing code for better performance. This project also helped me enhance my CSS skills, particularly in creating responsive designs and animations.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is an excellent resource for understanding JavaScript, CSS, and HTML concepts. It helped me clarify DOM manipulation and event handling.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site provided valuable insights into CSS animations and responsive design techniques.
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) - This comprehensive guide helped me deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and advanced topics.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A great platform for troubleshooting and finding solutions to specific coding challenges I encountered during the project.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used for selecting and integrating custom fonts into the project.
